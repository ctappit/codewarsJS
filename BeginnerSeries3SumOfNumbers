Challenge: Beginner Series #3 Sum of Numbers
    Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.
    Note: a and b are not ordered!

Solution:
    function GetSum( a,b ) {
    var sum = 0;
    if(a === b) {
      return a;
    } 
     else if(a < b) {
        for (a; a <= b; a++) {
           sum += a;
         }
      }
        else if (b < a) {
          for (b; b <= a; b++) {
            sum += b;
          }
        }
     return sum;
     }
